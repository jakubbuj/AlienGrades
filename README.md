# Project Goal
The goal of the project is to get experience with Scientific Research, Critical Thinking and Problem Solving, as well as learning to work in a project team.

# Phase 1
1. Learn to load data into memory.
2. Handle and manipulate data into separate sets.
3. Compute statistics on the data sets.
4. Understand concepts like data, information, and knowledge.
5. Practice looking at properties of a data set and identifying patterns.
6. Apply procedural programming concepts.
7. Work with multi-dimensional arrays using nested loops.
8. Gain exposure to machine learning and decision trees.

# Phase 2
1. Develop a user interface for simple data visualization.
2. Understand the importance of effective data visualizations.
3. Practice skills learned in the course on Objects in Programming.
4. Use visualizations during data exploration and presentation to potential stakeholders.

# Phase 3
1. Integrate skills from Phase 1 and Phase 2.
2. Develop a regression tree algorithm.
3. Implement Random Forests, a state-of-the-art machine learning method.
4. Produce accurate predictions about unobserved data using Random Forests.

# How to use the app 
1. Create a JavaFX project in an IDE of your choice.
2. Copy the source folder to your IDE's directory.
3. Run the program by executing HelloApplication.java
4. After a window loads, you can choose which information you want to display, and a type of chart in which you'd like to view the data in (if applicable).
5. Certain data can, or has to be filtered in order to display a graph. 
6. Go back to the selection menu by clicking the "Go back" button in the bottom left corner of the window.
